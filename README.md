Breathing Green is an air quality investigation project that originated from [Air Quality Data Hack](https://airqualitydatahack.com/) organized by Google. The main objective of this project is to recommend a green route to a cyclist that minimizes their exposure to pollutants by a specified pollutant index while travelling in Dublin from a specific starting point to a destination.

# Data
This repository contains the link for raw data acquired from Google AirQuality Hackthon and processed `csv`，`osm` files used in our research.

**Google Project Air View Data - Dublin City (May 2021 - August 2022)**: This dataset was collected by Google and Dublin City Council as part of Project Air View Dublin.
Google’s first electric Street View car, equipped with Aclima’s mobile air sensing platform, drove through the roads of Dublin City measuring street-by-street air quality. The data collection process predominantly took place from Monday to Friday between 9:00 am and 5:00 pm from May 2021 to August 2022.
