## Background

Breathing Green is an air quality investigation project that originated from [Air Quality Data Hack](https://airqualitydatahack.com/) organized by Google. The main objective of this project is to recommend a green route to a cyclist that minimizes their exposure to pollutants by a specified pollutant index while travelling in Dublin from a specific starting point to a destination.
